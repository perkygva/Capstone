#Task 1
#########
# Tokenization - identifying appropriate tokens such as words, punctuation, and numbers. 
# Writing a function that takes a file as input and returns a tokenized version of it.
# Profanity filtering - removing profanity and other words you do not want to predict.
# Tips, tricks, and hints

#########
#Task 2
#########
# Exploratory analysis - perform a thorough exploratory analysis of the data, understanding the distribution of words and relationship between the words in the corpora.
# Understand frequencies of words and word pairs - build figures and tables to understand variation in the frequencies of words and word pairs in the data.

#Task 3
##########
# Tasks to accomplish
# Build basic n-gram model - using the exploratory analysis you performed, 
#   build a basic n-gram model for predicting the next word based on the previous 1, 2, or 3 words.
# Build a model to handle unseen n-grams - 
#   in some cases people will want to type a combination of words that does not appear in the corpora. 
#   Build a model to handle cases where a particular n-gram isn't observed.
